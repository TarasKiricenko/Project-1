# SPACE INVADERS
First project on my learning path.

<h2>Brief:</h2>
My personal version of Space Invaders classical 80's game. Player aiming to shoot down all aliens, moving only right or left. Aliens slowly moving descending, randomly trying to drop bombs on player. As soon as all aliens are taken downs or player loses all 3 lives - game is over. Target is to achieve maximum point, each alien taken downs brings you 10 points. You can only have one bullet on screen, before it reaches the target or leaves game field, otherwise launching second one, first one eliminates.
