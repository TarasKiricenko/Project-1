# SPACE INVADERS
First project on my learning path.
<h1>Brief:</h1>
My personal version of Space Invaders classical 80's game. Player aiming to shoot down all aliens, moving only right or left. Aliens slowly moving descending, randomly trying to drop bombs on player. As soon as all aliens are taken downs or player loses all 3 lives - game is over.
